Lessons learned during the course of this project:
  -Vref pins (alternate mode of certain pins) are tied to a voltage consisting of half of a logic 1 within highspeed differential signaling. This is so the FPGA can easily distinguish between logic 1 and logic 0
  - Installing Quartus requires a few steps:
    - Install Zlib (sudo apt install zlib1g-dev)
    - Build Libpng:
      - Download Libpng (https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng12/)
      - Extract to /tmp
      - cd /tmp/libpng-*
      - ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
      - make
      - sudo make install
      - sudo ldconfig
