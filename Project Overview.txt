Description:
  Open Source clock powered by FPGA using 7 segment displays to display time.
  Called the OverClock because it will use a PLL within the FPGA to generate accurate timing for
  the clock, this is absolute overkill hence the name.

FPGA:
  - Something from Altera because I am familiar with their tools.

PCB CAD:
  - KiCAD

Enclosure:
  - OnShape

FPGA Toolchain:
  - Quartus Prime

Goals:
  - Total BOM cost under 100 NZD
  - Learn how to use PLLs (NOT clock dividing)
  - Time to be set via switches (UART header to be added and added as a nice to have)
  - Power input via USB-C (maybe USB-PD)

FPGA Power Supply Requirements:
  - 0.778W Max
  - 220mA max transient current
  - 3 or 3.3V

Current Calcs:
  - 20mA per GPIO
  - 7 Segments * 4 Digits * 20mA = 560mA

  - Typical Forward Voltage: 3.1V (3.3v System voltage works nicely)
  - 3.3v / 20mA = 165 Ohms
  - No resistor packs in stock with Digikey so using:

Power Supply Topology:
  - Buck Converter 5-12V in down to 3.3V
  - LDO from 3.3V to 3V to power FPGA
