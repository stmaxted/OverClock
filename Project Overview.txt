Description:
  Open Source clock powered by FPGA using 7 segment displays to display time.
  Called the OverClock because it will use a PLL within the FPGA to generate accurate timing for
  the clock, this is absolute overkill hence the name.

FPGA:
  - Something from Altera because I am familiar with their tools.

PCB CAD:
  - KiCAD

Enclosure:
  - OnShape

FPGA Toolchain:
  - Quartus Prime

Goals:
  - Total BOM cost under 100 NZD
  - Learn how to use PLLs (NOT clock dividing)
  - Time to be set via switches (UART header to be added and added as a nice to have)
  - Power input via USB-C (maybe USB-PD)
  -
