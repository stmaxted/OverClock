Selecting which Altera FPGA to use. I will be using Altera as I am familiar with.

Package:
  - Something I can solder by hand (IE no BGA packages)
  - QFN or DFN are ok but undesirable
  - Thus QFP is likely

Pin count:
  + 7 GPIO pins per digit
  + 4 digits (2 for hours, 2 for minutes)
  + 4 Switches (up and down for minutes and hours)
  = 32 GPIO pins minimum

Features:
  - FPGA must include at least one PLL


Chosen FPGA:
  - Intel MAX 10 10M02SCE144C8G
    - 2000, 4-input logic cells
    - 101 GPIO pins
    - 16 18X18 multipliers
    - 2 PLLs
    - 108kB memory
  - 12.12 NZD (single quantity)
